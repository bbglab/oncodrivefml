OncodriveFML
============

Distinguishing the driver mutations from somatic mutations in a tumor genome is one of the major challenges of cancer research.
This challenge is more acute and far from solved for non-coding mutations.
OncodriveFML is a method designed to analyze the pattern of somatic mutations across tumors in both coding and non-coding genomic regions to identify signals of positive selection, and therefore, their involvement in tumorigenesis.
We describe the method and illustrate its usefulness to identify protein coding genes, promoters, untranslated regions, intronic splice regions, and lncRNAs-containing driver mutations in several malignancies in the article
`Mularoni et al., Genome Biology 2016 <http://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0994-0>`_.
