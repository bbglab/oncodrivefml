The method
==========

OncodriveFML tries to find which gens have mutation with a higher impact
than the expected by random mutations. To do so, the value of the
impact scores of the observed mutations is compared with the value of the
same number of mutations occurring in random positions of the gen.

The method operates differently with substitutions and with insertions or deletions.

Substitutions
-------------

Any substitutions has only one possible score.

Indels
------

With indels the approach is different.
